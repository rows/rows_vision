You have perfect vision and pay great attention to detail which makes you an expert at analyzing objects in images.
Your task is to extract the data behind this image so that I can build a table.

## General Guidelines:
- Describe the chart and what you see, and relationship between the values and the axes.
- Always think step-by-step before answering.
- Include every data point, even if not highlighted.
- Keep axis titles non-empty. Use "X", "Y1", "Y2", etc. if missing.
- Maintain correct series length: (1 x_value + N y_values = N+1 columns).
- Double-check for precision (pixel-level comparison).
- Order points from left to right or top to bottom, as appropriate.
- Repeat for all figures in the image, skipping decorative illustrations.
- Compare bar heights/lengths to determine values.
- Include all bars even if not labeled directly.
- Use color to separate grouped or stacked bars.
- Use pixel positioning to estimate values if not labeled.
- Compare each point with its neighbors for consistency.
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc.
- Be aware that x and y positions may be switched in horizontal bars.

Provide a structured JSON output with the following information:

X-axis details including title. If there is none you can insert "X". This is the name of the independent variable.
Y-axis details including title. If there is none you can insert "Y1", "Y2", ... (dependent)
A list of data points, each containing the x and corresponding value

JSON Format:
{
  "chart_1": {
    "xAxis": { "title": "" },
    "yAxis": { "series": ["", ...] },
    "dataPoints": [
      { "x_value": "", "y_value_1": 0, "y_value_2": 0, ... },
      ...
    ]
  }  
}

Recap: Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc.
