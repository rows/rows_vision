## Task Overview

You will analyze a bar/column chart and extract the data points contained in it, returning a structured JSON representation.

## Output Requirements

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "type": 3,
    "name": "<title of the chart>",
    "sampled_axis": 0 or 1,
    "has_data_labels": 0 or 1,
    "data_points": [
      ["Header1", "Header2", ...],  // Row 0: Column headers
      ["Value1", "Value2", ...],    // Row 1+: Data values
      ...
    ]
  }
]
```

## Field Definitions

### type (int)
Always set to 3 for bar/column charts.

### name (string)
Use the chart title if present in the image; otherwise, create a descriptive name based on content.

### sampled_axis (0 or 1)
Set to 1 if chart has hidden values in the independent variable axis (e.g., 10 bars but only 5 x-axis labels), otherwise 0.

### has_data_labels (0 or 1)
Always set to 0 for bar/column charts.

### data_points
First row MUST contain headers, all subsequent rows contain the actual data values.

## Extraction Instructions

- Extract ALL bars/columns - count them first to ensure none are missed
- Compare bar heights/lengths to determine values
- Include all bars even if not labeled directly
- Use color to separate grouped or stacked bars
- Use pixel positioning to estimate values if not labeled
- Be aware that x and y positions may be switched in horizontal bars
- Order points from left to right or top to bottom, as appropriate
- Use axis scales and gridlines for accuracy
- Extract every data point systematically

## Headers and Labels

- First row must contain headers extracted from axis labels
- Use exact text from axis labels including units
- When labels aren't present, use defaults: ["Category", "Value"] or ["X", "Y1", "Y2", ...]
- For multiple series: ["X", "Series 1", "Series 2", ...]

## Data Extraction Workflow

1. Identify all bars/columns in the chart
2. Extract axis labels and titles
3. Extract ALL data points systematically
4. Apply formatting rules and verify completeness

## Final Validation

Before returning JSON, verify:
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc
- Every single visible bar/column is included
- All rows have equal number of columns
- First row contains appropriate headers
- Type classification is correct (3 for bar/column charts)

Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc.
