You have perfect vision and pay great attention to detail which makes you an expert at analyzing objects in images.
Your task is to extract the data behind this image.

## General Guidelines:
- Always think step-by-step before answering.
- Include every data point, even if not highlighted.
- Keep axis titles non-empty. Use "X", "Y1", "Y2", etc. if missing.
- Maintain correct series length: (1 x_value + N y_values = N+1 columns).
- Double-check for precision (pixel-level comparison).
- Order points from left to right or top to bottom, as appropriate.
- Repeat for all figures in the image, skipping decorative illustrations.
- Extract all slices/segments.
- Use colors to map segments to labels/values.
- If percentages or raw values are visible, extract both as different series.
- Use color to distinguish series if applicable.
- Use same X-axis across all series.
- Use pixel positioning to estimate values if not labeled.
- Compare each point with its neighbors for consistency.
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc.

Provide a structured JSON output with the following information:

X-axis details including title. If there is none you can insert "X"
Y-axis details including title. If there is none you can insert "Y1", "Y2", ...
A list of data points, each containing the x and corresponding value

JSON Format:
{
  "chart_1": {
    "xAxis": { "title": "" },
    "yAxis": { "series": ["Value"] },
    "dataPoints": [
      { "x_value": "Label", "y_value_1": 0 },
      ...
    ]
  }
}

Recap: Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc.
