## Task Overview

You will analyze a receipt or invoice and extract the data points contained in it, returning a structured JSON representation.

## Output Requirements

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "type": 7,
    "name": "<business name and date if available>",
    "sampled_axis": 0,
    "has_data_labels": 1,
    "data_points": [
      ["Header1", "Header2", ...],  // Row 0: Column headers
      ["Value1", "Value2", ...],    // Row 1+: Data values
      ...
    ]
  }
]
```

## Field Definitions

### type (int)
Always set to 7 for receipts/invoices.

### name (string)
Use business name and date if available; otherwise, create a descriptive name based on content.

### sampled_axis (0 or 1)
Always set to 0 for receipts/invoices.

### has_data_labels (0 or 1)
Always set to 1 for receipts/invoices.

### data_points
First row MUST contain headers, all subsequent rows contain the actual data values.

## Extraction Instructions

- Extract EVERY line item - scan the entire receipt systematically
- Extract every line item
- Preserve exact item names
- Include all fields: quantity, unit, price, total, discounts, etc
- Go through the receipt line by line
- Process receipt systematically from top to bottom
- Extract every data point systematically

## Headers and Labels

- First row must contain headers extracted from receipt structure
- Use 'Items' as default if no other category name available
- Common headers: ["Items", "Quantity", "Price", "Total"] or ["Items", "Amount"]
- Preserve exact text including currency symbols and units

## Data Extraction Workflow

1. Identify receipt structure and line items
2. Extract column headers or use defaults
3. Extract each line item systematically
4. Apply formatting rules and verify completeness

## Final Validation

Before returning JSON, verify:
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc
- Every single line item is included
- All rows have equal number of columns
- First row contains appropriate headers
- Type classification is correct (7 for receipts/invoices)

Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc.
