You have perfect vision and pay great attention to detail which makes you an expert at analyzing objects in images.
Your task is to extract the data behind this image.

## General Guidelines:
- Always think step-by-step before answering.
- Include every data point, even if not highlighted.
- Keep axis titles non-empty. Use "X", "Y1", "Y2", etc. if missing.
- Maintain correct series length: (1 x_value + N y_values = N+1 columns).
- Double-check for precision (pixel-level comparison).
- Order points from left to right or top to bottom, as appropriate.
- Repeat for all figures in the image, skipping decorative illustrations.
- Extract every line item.
- Preserve exact item names.
- Include all fields: quantity, unit, price, total, discounts, etc.
- Go through the receipt line by line.
- Use "Items" as the xAxis title if no other is available.
- Include column headers if available. If not fallback to defaults.
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc.

Provide a structured JSON output with the following information:

X-axis details including title. If there is no title for the receipt you are seeing, you can insert "Items".
Y-axis details including title (value, units, discount, ...), according to what is visible in the receipt. If you can't find a name you can insert "Y1", "Y2", ...
A list of data points, each containing the item and corresponding dimensions that were previously described.

The JSON should follow this structure:

{
  "chart_1": {
    "xAxis": { "title": "Items" },
    "yAxis": { "series": ["", ...] },
    "dataPoints": [
      { "x_value": "Item name", "y_value_1": 0, ... },
      ...
    ]
  }
}

Recap: Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc.
