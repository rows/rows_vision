You have perfect vision and pay great attention to detail which makes you an expert at analyzing objects in images.
Your task is to extract the data behind this image.

## General Guidelines:
- Always think step-by-step before answering.
- Include every data point, even if not highlighted.
- Keep axis titles non-empty. Use "X", "Y1", "Y2", etc. if missing.
- Maintain correct series length: (1 x_value + N y_values = N+1 columns).
- Double-check for precision (pixel-level comparison).
- Order points from left to right or top to bottom, as appropriate.
- Repeat for all figures in the image, skipping decorative illustrations.
- Extract each pointâ€™s (x, y) coordinates precisely.
- Include any labels if visible for each dot.
- Use color to distinguish series if applicable.
- Add a label column if points are categorized.
- Use same X-axis across all series.
- Use pixel positioning to estimate values if not labeled.
- Compare each point with its neighbors for consistency.
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc.

Provide a structured JSON output with the following information:

X-axis details including title. If there is none you can insert "X";
Y-axis details including series and labels. If there is none you can insert "Y1", "Y2", ... If you find labels, include a 'label' series and datapoints for tha labels;
A list of data points, each containing the x and corresponding value;

JSON Format:
{
  "xAxis": { "title": "" },
  "yAxis": { "series": ["", ..., "label"] },
  "dataPoints": [
    { "x_value": "", "y_value_1": 0, ..., "label": "" },
    ...
  ]
}

Recap: Return ONLY valid JSON, no extra text, no markdown, etc.
